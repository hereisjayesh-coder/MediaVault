## [Unreleased]

### Added — Project foundation

- Initial multi-module Gradle project (`app`, `core:model`, `core:common`,
  `core:domain`, `core:database`) using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Material 3.
- Minimal black/AMOLED Compose theme.
- Bottom-navigation skeleton with placeholder screens: Home, Downloads, Library,
  Player, Settings.
- Room database foundation (`MediaVaultDatabase`) with `download_tasks` and
  `media_items` tables.
- Core architecture interfaces establishing the abstraction boundaries the rest of the
  app will be built against: `ExtractorEngine`, `DownloadEngine`, `TorrentEngine`,
  `NetworkPolicyManager`, `UpdateManager`, `PlayerEngine`.
- Hilt wired in for dependency injection, with the Room database as the first provided
  dependency.
- Repository documentation: README, LICENSE, PRIVACY, TERMS, CONTRIBUTING,
  THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.

No extraction, downloading, media processing, or torrent functionality is implemented
yet — this stage is the architectural foundation only.
